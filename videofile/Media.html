                <div class="artist-info">Eraserheads</div>
                <p>Along with other Philippine rock songs at the time such as "Iskolar ng Bayan" by Yano and "Laklak" by Teeth, "Alapaap" became a subject of controversy due to its suggestive lyrics, which Senator Tito Sotto saw as promoting drug use. Sotto, who was a member of the Citizens' Drug Watch, called for the song to be banned from radio in August 1995. The band responded with a letter to the senator stating that it was a misinterpretation and that the song was their "ode to freedom", not drug abuse. "That is freedom of expression," stated writer Ely Buendia.</p>
