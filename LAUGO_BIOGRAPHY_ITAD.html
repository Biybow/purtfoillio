            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Cyril Marius Maaño Laugo, but you can call me Bibo.<sup>1</sup> 
                I was born on February 13, 2005, in Boac, Marinduque, a peaceful province known for its rich culture and traditions.<sup>2</sup> 
                I am the youngest of two children of my loving parents, Joey Larga Laugo and Irene Mendros Maaño, who have always supported and guided me in life.<sup>3</sup>
                My older sister, Christine Joy Laugo, has been both a role model and a constant companion throughout my journey.<sup>4</sup>
                I currently reside in Lupac, Boac, Marinduque, where I have spent most of my childhood and teenage years.<sup>5</sup>
                Growing up in a close-knit community, I learned the values of simplicity, kindness, and respect for others.<sup>6</sup>
                From an early age, I found joy in the simplest things, which shaped my curiosity and appreciation for life.<sup>7</sup>
                I loved playing basic games, whether it was running around with friends, solving puzzles, or engaging in small adventures around our home.<sup>8</sup>
                I also developed a fascination for counting boxes and sticks at the Day Care Center, which unknowingly sparked my early interest in numbers and patterns.<sup>9</sup>
                One of my fondest childhood memories was sharing food with my classmates, as it made me feel connected and happy.<sup>10</sup>
                I always looked forward to snack time, knowing that it was an opportunity to bond with others and learn the joy of giving.<sup>11</sup>
                My nursery and kindergarten years were spent at Little Star Pre-School, where I had my first experience with formal education.<sup>12</sup>
                It was in this school that I developed my writing and reading skills, slowly building confidence in expressing myself.<sup>13</sup>
                I enjoyed learning new words, forming sentences, and listening to stories read by my teachers.<sup>14</sup>
                The school also helped me build strong study habits, encouraging me to explore the world of books and knowledge.<sup>15</sup>
                I was introduced to the beauty of letters, numbers, and creativity through drawing and storytelling.<sup>16</sup>
                Aside from academics, participating in various school and community activities played a huge role in shaping my personality.<sup>17</sup>
                Engaging in these activities allowed me to interact with different people, learn teamwork, and understand responsibility.<sup>18</sup>
                Whether it was a simple classroom task, a school event, or a community gathering, I found excitement in being involved.<sup>19</sup>
                These experiences opened my eyes to the deeper meaning of life, teaching me that success is not just about academic achievements but also about building character, helping others, and making meaningful connections.<sup>20</sup>
                Looking back, my childhood was filled with valuable lessons that continue to guide me today.<sup>21</sup>

        <!-- Teenage Years Section -->
        <section id="teenage">
            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <div align="justify">
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my elementary education, I attended Don Luis Hidalgo Memorial School from Grade 1 to Grade 3, where I built a strong foundation in academics and social interactions.<sup>1</sup>
                I enjoyed learning new subjects, making friends, and participating in school activities that helped shape my early interests.<sup>2</sup>
                However, a major change in my life happened when my older sister, Christine Joy Laugo, graduated from Grade 6 and transferred to Marinduque National High School, where my mother is a permanent teacher.<sup>3</sup>
                Since I had always looked up to my sister and enjoyed her company, I felt a deep sense of sadness when she moved to a different school.<sup>4</sup>
                Seeing my disappointment, my parents decided to enroll me at St. Mary's College of Marinduque (SMCM) instead, a decision that would greatly influence my personal and spiritual growth.<sup>5</sup>
                At SMCM, I found a welcoming and nurturing environment where I thrived academically and spiritually.<sup>6</sup>
                I was constantly surrounded by the Sisters and priests, whose presence provided me with guidance, wisdom, and inspiration.<sup>7</sup>
                Their teachings encouraged me to deepen my faith and live a life centered on service and humility.<sup>8</sup>
                Since Grade 3, I have been a Knight of the Altar, a role that brought me closer to God, the church, and the values of discipline and devotion.<sup>9</sup>
                Serving during Holy Mass became a significant part of my routine, and I found great fulfillment in assisting priests and being part of the church community.<sup>10</sup>
                My seven years at SMCM (from Grade 4 to high school) were filled with unforgettable experiences and life-changing lessons.<sup>11</sup>
                I developed strong friendships, engaged in various extracurricular activities, and created memories that I will always cherish.<sup>12</sup>
                One of the highlights of my high school life was my first dance at our JS Prom, a moment that symbolized growth and new experiences.<sup>13</sup>
                That night, I was honored to be named Star of the Night, a recognition that made the event even more special.<sup>14</sup>
                During these years, I also experienced my first relationship, which taught me valuable lessons about emotions, understanding, and personal growth.<sup>15</sup>
                Beyond academics, I actively participated in various clubs, scouting, volleyball games, and competitions, all of which shaped my skills and character.<sup>16</sup>
                Scouting, in particular, played a huge role in developing my leadership, teamwork, and survival skills.<sup>17</sup>
                Volleyball became a passion, as it allowed me to bond with teachers and classmates while staying active.<sup>18</sup>
                Every competition, whether academic or sports-related, pushed me to improve myself and strive for excellence.<sup>19</sup>
                My involvement in these activities not only strengthened my self-confidence but also deepened my sense of responsibility and discipline.<sup>20</sup>
                For senior high school (Grades 11 and 12), I transferred to Marinduque National High School, where my mother teaches.<sup>21</sup>
                This transition was both exciting and challenging, as I knew that being a student in the same school as my mother meant I had to uphold her reputation and make her proud.<sup>22</sup>
                This sense of responsibility motivated me to work harder in my studies and actively participate in school activities.<sup>23</sup>
                It was during this period that I was able to refine my computer skills, both inside and outside the classroom, preparing me for the future.<sup>24</sup>
                My involvement in church-related activities also continued in senior high school.<sup>25</sup>
                I became a member of SoCoM (Commission on Social Communication), where I helped broadcast live Masses and other church events.<sup>26</sup>
                This role allowed me to combine my passion for technology and faith, as I worked with a team to ensure that religious services reached a wider audience.<sup>27</sup>
                It was also during Grade 11 that I passed the Seminary Entrance Examination, marking a significant milestone in my spiritual journey.<sup>28</sup>
                However, my mother advised me to first complete a four-year degree before entering the seminary, believing that a strong educational background would better equip me for the path I wanted to take.<sup>29</sup>
                During this time, I also developed a close connection with the Bishop of our Diocese, who encouraged me to join him in biking and playing basketball.<sup>30</sup>
                These activities were not just recreational—they became opportunities for deeper conversations about faith, life, and personal growth.<sup>31</sup>
                Through these interactions, I learned more about the responsibilities of priesthood, the joys of service, and the importance of balance in life.<sup>32</sup>
                Looking back, my journey through elementary, high school, and senior high school was filled with valuable experiences that shaped my character, faith, and aspirations.<sup>33</sup>
                Each challenge and milestone prepared me for the next stage of my life, giving me the confidence to move forward with determination, faith, and a heart ready to serve.<sup>34</sup>

            <h2>College Years</h2>
            <div align="justify">
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am a second-year BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) student at the University of the East (UE), where I continue to develop my skills and knowledge in technology.<sup>1</sup>
                My decision to enroll in this university was influenced by my aunt, who is a Cum Laude graduate of BS Psychology from the same institution.<sup>2</sup>
                She has always been a source of inspiration, encouraging me to pursue my studies with dedication and perseverance.<sup>3</sup>
                Adjusting to college life has been a challenge, especially since it is my first time being away from home for an extended period.<sup>4</sup>
                Being far from my mother and family in Marinduque has made me realize the value of independence and responsibility.<sup>5</sup>
                However, I make sure to go home on long weekends whenever possible to spend time with my loved ones before returning to Manila for another week of academic commitments.<sup>6</sup>
                Each visit reminds me of the warmth of home and recharges my motivation to continue striving for success.<sup>7</sup>
                Despite the challenges, I have found ways to stay grounded and balanced while pursuing my education.<sup>8</sup>
                Beyond academics, I continue my mission as an Eagle Scout, a prestigious rank I earned in Grade 12 after years of dedication to scouting.<sup>9</sup>
                The lessons I learned through scouting—discipline, leadership, teamwork, and service—remain an integral part of my college journey.<sup>10</sup>
                Through my NSTP outreach programs, I have had the privilege of engaging with various communities, particularly children in underserved barangays.<sup>11</sup>
                These experiences have been humbling, as I witness firsthand the struggles and resilience of people who have so little yet carry so much hope.<sup>12</sup>
                Seeing the smiles on the children's faces has reinforced my sense of purpose and deepened my commitment to service.<sup>13</sup>
                I also make sure to integrate my scouting skills into my college physical education sessions, where I apply principles of discipline, endurance, and teamwork.<sup>14</sup>
                The research skills I developed during senior high school have proven invaluable in my college studies, helping me analyze problems critically and find innovative solutions.<sup>15</sup>
                My courses have allowed me to explore programming, networking, and software development, giving me a clearer vision of my future career in technology.<sup>16</sup>
                Despite the demanding nature of my coursework, I strive to maintain a balanced lifestyle by actively participating in both academic and extracurricular activities.<sup>17</sup>
                I have also developed strong relationships with my classmates, professors, and school staff, creating a supportive network that makes college life more enjoyable.<sup>18</sup>
                Whenever possible, I continue to be involved in church activities, as my faith remains a central part of my life.<sup>19</sup>
                Every challenge I encounter in college is an opportunity for growth, pushing me to become more resilient, resourceful, and goal-driven.<sup>20</sup>
                The transition from high school to university has taught me that success is not just about academic excellence but also about personal development, service to others, and faith in God.<sup>21</sup>
                I remind myself daily that my education is not just for me—it is a path that will allow me to help others in the future.<sup>22</sup>
                As I continue my journey, I remain committed to learning, serving, and growing in all aspects of my life.<sup>23</sup>
                I embrace each new experience as a stepping stone toward a brighter future, one that is filled with knowledge, purpose, and compassion.<sup>24</sup>
                My goal is not just to earn a degree but to become a person who can make a meaningful impact on society.<sup>25</sup>
                With determination, faith, and the support of my family and mentors, I am confident that I will achieve my dreams and become the best version of myself.<sup>26</sup>
